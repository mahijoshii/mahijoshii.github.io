      <h3>To reduce your carbon footprint, you can make these lifestyle changes:</h3>
      <p class="list">1. Reduce, reuse, and recycle</p>
      <p class="description">Everything has a carbon footprint, including paper, electronics, packaging, and water. You can actually change things by cutting back on the garbage you produce, recycling rubbish, and reusing equipment.</p>
      
    <p class= "list">2. Eliminate single-use plastic </p>
      <p class="description">Although single-use plastics are practical, they are actually very bad for the environment. In addition to polluting our oceans and streams, they also use energy to make and recycle. To lessen your carbon impact, quit using throwaway items like silverware and coffee cups.</p>

      <p class="list">3. Turn off applicances that are not in use</p>
      <p class="description">Powering unoccupied offices and rooms uses a lot of electricity. You may avoid wasting energy by making sure to turn off lights and appliances when they're not in use. To solve the problem, you might alternatively ask to have automatic, motion-detecting lighting and energy-efficient LED bulbs installed.</p>

      <p class="list">4. Use less water </p>
      <p class="description">Processing and delivering water to our houses requires both energy and resources. Furthermore, heating it once it is there also consumes a lot of energy. Consequently, you may protect the environment and reduce your carbon footprint by using less. Consider taking brief showers instead of baths, turning off the faucets when brushing your teeth, and only boiling the water you actually need.</p>

      <p class="list">5. Switch to renewables </p>
      <p class="description">Greener rates are currently being offered by energy providers all around the world. You can lower your household emissions and save money on your energy costs by moving to a firm that uses electricity generated by solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. If solar panels are widely available where you live, you could even put them in.</p>
