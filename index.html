    <h1> Long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns are referred to as climate change. Human activities have been the primary cause of climate change since the 1800s, mostly as a result of burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. People are at risk from climate change because it will lead to a lack of food and water, increased flooding, severe storms, loss of species, high heat, an increase in disease, poverty, and economic loss.

    <h1 id="climateclock">We only have 6 years to limit global temperature rise to 1.5Â°C increase per year, before climate change becomes irreversible!</h1>
