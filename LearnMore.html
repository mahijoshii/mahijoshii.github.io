    <h2 class="headline">Power & Electricity</h2>

    <p class="LMTxt">Climate change is linked to pollution, which is typically seen as an urban landscape byproduct. Burning fossil fuels raises CO2 emissions, which contribute to global warming and exacerbate both climate change and air pollution. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, or gas to produce power and heat is a major contributor to the greenhouse gases that cover the Earth and trap solar heat, such carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. The effects of air pollution on a person's body can vary based on the kind of pollutant, the length and intensity of exposure, as well as other factors including the particular health risks of each person and the combined effects of several pollutants or stressors.

    <h2 class="headline">Glaciers Melting & Rising Sea Levels</h2>
    <p class="LMTxt">As temperatures rise, glaciers melt more rapidly than they can rebuild their ice. The water eventually flows into the ocean when these ice sheets and glaciers melt, raising the sea level. Melting glaciers contribute to sea level rise, which in turn causes coastal erosion to increase and storm surge to increase as a result of more frequent and stronger coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons brought on by increasing ocean and air temperatures. The two ice sheets that contribute most to the rise in sea level worldwide are those in Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland's ice sheet is already melting four times faster than it did in 2003, and it already accounts for 20% of the current rise in sea level. Check out <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/why-are-glaciers-and-sea-ice-melting#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20effects%20of,storms%20like%20hurricanes%20and%20typhoons.">World Wildlife</a> to learn more about why glaciers and sea ice are melting.</p>

    <h2 class="headline">Agriculture</h2>

    <p class="LMTxt">In many nations, agriculture is the main cause of pollution and a significant contributor to the climate crisis. Pesticides, fertilizers, and other harmful agricultural chemicals have the potential to contaminate fresh water, marine ecosystems, air, and soil. They may also linger in the environment for many years. Numerous pesticides are considered to be interfering with both people and wildlife's hormonal systems. Coral reefs and streams are impacted by fertilizer runoff. In addition, 19–29% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions now are produced by agriculture. If nothing is done, that proportion might significantly increase as other industries cut their emissions.  To accomplish climate targets and lessen environmental stress, addressing food loss and waste is essential.
